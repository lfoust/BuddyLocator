    <description>The Buddy Platform is an incredibly rich platform of APIs designed to support end-to-end scenarios. While many cloud products employ "feature-based engineering", Buddy is a "scenario-engineered" product. That means we offer APIs designed to solve for complete scenarios, rather than individual features like generic hosted databases or storage.</description>
